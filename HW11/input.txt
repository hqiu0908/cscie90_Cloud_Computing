Cloud computing, also known as on-demand computing, is a kind of internet-based
computing, where shared resources and information are provided to computers and
other devices on-demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access
to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.[1][2] Cloud computing and
storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to
store and process their data in third-party data centers.[3] It relies on
sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a
utility (like the electricity grid) over a network.[4] At the foundation of
cloud computing is the broader concept of converged infrastructure and shared
services.

Cloud computing, or in simpler shorthand just "the cloud", also focuses on
maximizing the effectiveness of the shared resources. Cloud resources are
usually not only shared by multiple users but are also dynamically reallocated
per demand. This can work for allocating resources to users. For example, a
cloud computer facility that serves European users during European business
hours with a specific application (e.g., email) may reallocate the same
resources to serve North American users during North America's business hours
with a different application (e.g., a web server). This approach helps maximize
the use of computing power while reducing the overall cost of resources by using
less power, air conditioning, rack space, etc. to maintain the system. With
cloud computing, multiple users can access a single server to retrieve and
update their data without purchasing licenses for different applications.

The term "moving to cloud" also refers to an organization moving away from a
traditional CAPEX model (buy the dedicated hardware and depreciate it over a
period of time) to the OPEX model (use a shared cloud infrastructure and pay as
one uses it).[dubious - discuss]
