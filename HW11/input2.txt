MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing
and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a
cluster.[1][2] Conceptually similar approaches have been very well known since
1995 with the Message Passing Interface [3] standard having reduce [4] and
scatter operations.[5]

A MapReduce program is composed of a Map() procedure (method) that performs
filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one
queue for each name) and a Reduce() method that performs a summary operation
(such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name
frequencies). The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or
"framework") orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed servers,
running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data
transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy
and fault tolerance.

The model is inspired by the map and reduce functions commonly used in
functional programming,[6] although their purpose in the MapReduce framework is
not the same as in their original forms.[7] The key contributions of the
MapReduce framework are not the actual map and reduce functions, but the
scalability and fault-tolerance achieved for a variety of applications by
optimizing the execution engine once. As such, a single-threaded implementation
of MapReduce will usually not be faster than a traditional (non-MapReduce)
implementation, any gains are usually only seen with multi-threaded
implementations.[8] The use of this model is beneficial only when the optimized
distributed shuffle operation (which reduces network communication cost) and
fault tolerance features of the MapReduce framework come into play. Optimizing
the communication cost is essential to a good MapReduce algorithm.[9]

MapReduce libraries have been written in many programming languages, with
different levels of optimization. A popular open-source implementation that has
support for distributed shuffles is part of Apache Hadoop. The name MapReduce
originally referred to the proprietary Google technology, but has since been
genericized. By 2014, Google were no longer using MapReduce as a big data
processing model,[10] and development on Apache Mahout had moved on to more
capable and less disk-oriented mechanisms that incorporated full map and reduce
capabilities.[11]
